Usage and Rights:

The libraries we use will be stated in this README or in a seperate file. Those libraries and api's are under the usage terms
of their respective authors and companies. Any code not under the constraints of those terms are probably written by us, and
code is CURRENTLY free for use as long as credit is recieved for the contribution. To be honest, we'd really just appreciate a
pull request or at least some message before you do anything, just to be on the safe side. Thanks.
